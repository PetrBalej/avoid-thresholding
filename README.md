# Avoid thresholding
Avoid thresholding and all artificial categorization and classification **when unnecessary**.

E.g. *classical* biological: 
1. classification and taxonomy
2. biogeography
3. biocoenosis (community, assemblage)

Dolphin (threshold dependent): I breathe through the threshold. Bird (threshold terminated): Killed by an artificial threshold.](comics-avoid-artificial-threshold.png "Killed by an artificial threshold.")
